--  This package contains the routines for supporting the Image attribute for
--  signed integer types larger than Size Integer'Size, and also for conversion
--  operations required in Text_IO.Integer_IO for such types.

package System.Img_LLI is
pragma Preelaborate (Img_LLI);

   function Image_Long_Long_Integer
     (V    : Long_Long_Integer;
      S    : access String)
      return Natural;
   --  Computes Long_Long_Integer'Image (V) and stores the result in S (1 .. N)
   --  where N is the length of the image string. The value of N is returned as
   --  the result. The caller guarantees that the string is long enough.

   procedure Set_Image_Long_Long_Integer
     (V : Long_Long_Integer;
      S : out String;
      P : in out Natural);
   --  Sets the image of V starting at S (P + 1) with no leading spaces (i.e.
   --  Text_IO format where Width = 0), starting at S (P + 1), updating P
   --  to point to the last character stored. The caller promises that the
   --  buffer is large enough and no check is made for this (Constraint_Error
   --  will not be necessarily raised if this is violated since it is perfectly
   --  valid to compile this unit with checks off).
